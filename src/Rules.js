// testing testing testing here is something I want to check on git changes
// on november 8 2021, i accidently did a git init on the src folder, when I did git init in the parent folder yahtzee-starter aswell, then added a remote repository to push to. it pushed verything but the src folder becuase it saw that as a seperate folder. so, i had to delete the git directory i created there with this command, rm -rf .git, then it worked fine.
